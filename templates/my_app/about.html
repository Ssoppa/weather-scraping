                    <span class="card-title"><b>Inspiration</b></span>
                    <p>Everything started when I decided that I would learn about Web Scraping.</p>
                    <p>Since I google "How is the weather" a lot, and the websites are too visually stressful,
                        that's what I was going to stackle.</p>

                    <span class="card-title"><b>Creative Research</b></span>
                    <p>I made a research about what really matters about weather and asked people about how they
                        search it. With that in mind, I finally was able to design this website.</p>

                    <p>After I learn about WebScraping, I choose a website to scrape, but as the BeautifulSoup
                        couldn't get all the data from there, I changed it to another one.</p>
                    <p>Finally, learned Materialize by doing the frontend.</p>
